LIBDUCK
~~~~~~~

libduck is a library for the parsing of Daisy 2.02 files for audio books.

DEVELOPERS
~~~~~~~~~~

Build using traditional ./configure && make commands.
Try ./configure --help for list of available build options.

ALWAYS consider duck.h as the ONLY public header.
Private definitions have to go to duck_internals.h
NEVER use printf(), always use dd_log().
Check your code for warnings before commits.

Versioning policy
--
The major version means no backward compatibility to previous versions (e.g.
removal of a function from the public API). The minor version means backward
compatible change (e.g. addition of a function to the public API or extension
of an existing data structure). The micro version means a noteworthy binary
compatible change (e.g. new grabber).
